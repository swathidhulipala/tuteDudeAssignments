Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 



Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:

1\.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.

2\.   Returns the calculated factorial.

3\.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.





The program checks if the input can be converted to a number, else provides a message to enter a number





Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
